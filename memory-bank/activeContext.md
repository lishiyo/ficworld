# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Implementing FicWorld V1 Architecture - Phase 7: V1 Improvements - Part 1**
  - Subtask 7.1 (Enhance Character Data & Loading) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.2 (Enhance Agent Prompts) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.3 (Implement Relationship Manager - Basic) is **completed**.
  - About to start **Subtask 7.4: Integrate Relationships & Summaries into Agents**.

## What's Working
- **V1 Data Model:** `CharacterConfig` and `InitialGoals` Pydantic models defined.
- **V1 Example Role:** `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json` created.
- **V1 Config Loading:** `modules/config_loader.py` updated for V1 roles.
- **V1 Character Agent Init:** `modules/character_agent.py` initializes with `CharacterConfig`.
- **V1 Prompt Helpers & Narrator Style:** `CharacterAgent` prompt helpers and `Narrator.render()` updated for V1.
- **Relationship Manager:** `modules/relationship_manager.py` implemented with core logic and passing unit tests.
- **Core V1 Unit Tests:**
    - `tests/test_data_models.py`
    - `tests/test_character_agent_v1.py`
    - `tests/test_memory_manager_v1.py`
    - `tests/test_narrator_v1.py`
    - `tests/test_relationship_manager.py` (assuming this exists and is passing for 7.3)
    - These tests are passing after recent refactoring and fixes.

## What's Broken / To Be Implemented / Needs Improvement
- **Main and WorldAgent Tests:** `tests/test_main.py` and `tests/test_world_agent.py` are currently failing (expected, pending Subtask 7.4).
- **Full V1 Context Integration:** Prompts in `CharacterAgent` are ready for richer V1 contexts, but data from `PerspectiveFilter`, `PlotManager` isn't being passed yet. `RelationshipManager` context also needs to be integrated (part of Subtask 7.4).
- **`load_full_preset` in `ConfigLoader`:** Still needs full adaptation for V1 `CharacterConfig` files.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Next Subtask:** Proceed with Subtask 7.4: Integrate Relationships & Summaries into Agents.
- **V1 Focus:** Continue prioritizing V1 architecture implementation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to V1 design documents.
- Modular design, Pydantic for data modeling, incremental development with unit testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Documentation Accuracy:** Crucial to keep progress documentation in sync with actual development.
- **Test Maintenance:** Keeping tests aligned with evolving data models and library-specific error messages is crucial and requires ongoing attention.
- **Refactoring Impact:** Changes in one module (like `CharacterAgent` moving to `CharacterConfig`) have ripple effects that require updates in dependent modules and their tests. Staging these integrations (like Subtask 7.4) helps manage complexity.

## Current Database/Model State
- `CharacterConfig`, `InitialGoals` in `modules/data_models.py`.
- `RelationshipManager` and `RelationshipState` in `modules/relationship_manager.py`.
- Example V1 role file `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json`.
- No persistent database in use.
