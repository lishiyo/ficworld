# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Implementing FicWorld V1 Architecture - Phase 7: V1 Improvements**
  - Subtask 7.1 (Enhance Character Data & Loading) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.2 (Enhance Agent Prompts) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.3 (Implement Relationship Manager - Basic) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.4 (Integrate Relationships & Summaries into Agents) is **completed**.
  - About to start **Subtask 7.5: Define Subjective Data Structures**.

## What's Working
- **V1 Data Model:** `CharacterConfig` and `InitialGoals` Pydantic models defined.
- **V1 Example Role:** `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json` created.
- **V1 Config Loading:** `modules/config_loader.py` updated for V1 roles.
- **V1 Character Agent Init:** `modules/character_agent.py` initializes with `CharacterConfig`.
- **V1 Prompt Helpers & Narrator Style:** `CharacterAgent` prompt helpers and `Narrator.render()` updated for V1.
- **Relationship Manager:** `modules/relationship_manager.py` implemented with core logic.
- **Memory Manager Summaries:** `modules/memory_manager.py` provides `get_recent_scene_summaries()`.
- **Integration of Relationships & Summaries (Subtask 7.4):**
    - `main.py` instantiates `RelationshipManager` and passes contexts to `CharacterAgent`.
    - `CharacterAgent` methods (`reflect_sync`, `plan_sync`) accept and use `relationship_context` and `scene_summary_context`.
    - `WorldAgent` uses `RelationshipManager` to update relationship states based on interaction outcomes.
- **Core V1 Unit Tests:**
    - `tests/test_data_models.py`
    - `tests/test_character_agent_v1.py` (verifies V1 context usage in prompts)
    - `tests/test_memory_manager_v1.py` (includes tests for scene summaries)
    - `tests/test_narrator_v1.py`
    - `tests/test_relationship_manager.py`
    - `tests/test_world_agent.py` (includes tests for `apply_plan` updating relationships)
    - These tests are passing for the V1 features implemented so far.

## What's Broken / To Be Implemented / Needs Improvement
- **Full V1 Context Integration:** Prompts in `CharacterAgent` are now receiving relationship and scene summary contexts. Integration of `PerspectiveFilter` (subjective views) and `PlotManager` contexts are pending later subtasks.
- **`load_full_preset` in `ConfigLoader`:** Still needs full adaptation for V1 `CharacterConfig` files if not already robust (review during overall V1 testing). Note: `main.py` uses `role_archetype.archetype_name` for character agent keys, which might need to align with `CharacterConfig.full_name` for consistency later.
- **WorldAgent LLM-based Relationship Interpretation:** The `WorldAgent._interpret_outcome_for_relationship_update` uses placeholder logic. Full LLM-based interpretation is deferred.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Next Subtask:** Proceed with Subtask 7.5: Define Subjective Data Structures.
- **V1 Focus:** Continue prioritizing V1 architecture implementation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to V1 design documents (`systemPatterns.md`, `prompt_design.md`).
- Modular design, Pydantic for data modeling, incremental development with unit testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Test-Driven Corrections:** Iteratively running tests and fixing issues (like LLM mock targets, or ensuring `update_from_outcome` is called) is crucial for verifying integrations.
- **Context Passing:** Ensuring new context data (like relationship and summary strings) correctly flows from `main.py` through to `CharacterAgent` and its prompt helpers is a key integration step.

## Current Database/Model State
- `CharacterConfig`, `InitialGoals` in `modules/data_models.py`.
- `RelationshipManager` and `RelationshipState` in `modules/relationship_manager.py`.
- `MemoryManager` in `modules/memory_manager.py` with scene summary capabilities.
- Example V1 role file `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json`.
- No persistent database in use.
