## Current Work Focus
- **Implementing FicWorld V1 Architecture - Phase 7: V1 Improvements - Part 1**
  - Subtask 7.1 (Enhance Character Data & Loading) is **completed**.
  - Subtask 7.2 (Enhance Agent Prompts) is **completed**.
  - About to start **Subtask 7.3: Implement Relationship Manager (Basic)**.

## What's Working
- **V1 Data Model:** `CharacterConfig` and `InitialGoals` Pydantic models defined in `modules/data_models.py`.
- **V1 Example Role:** `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json` created and conforms to `CharacterConfig`.
- **V1 Config Loading:** `modules/config_loader.py` has `load_character_config_v1` for V1 role files.
- **V1 Character Agent Init:** `modules/character_agent.py` correctly initializes with `CharacterConfig`.
- **V1 Prompt Helpers:** `CharacterAgent` prompt helpers and `Narrator.render()` updated for V1 designs and `author_style`.
- **Core V1 Unit Tests:**
    - `tests/test_data_models.py` (for V1 models like `CharacterConfig`).
    - `tests/test_character_agent_v1.py` (for V1 `CharacterAgent` features).
    - `tests/test_memory_manager_v1.py` (for V1 `MemoryManager` features like `get_recent_scene_summaries`).
    - `tests/test_narrator_v1.py` (for V1 `Narrator` features like `author_style`).
    - These tests are now passing after recent refactoring and fixes.

## What's Broken / To Be Implemented / Needs Improvement
- **Main and WorldAgent Tests:** `tests/test_main.py` and `tests/test_world_agent.py` are currently failing. This is expected as `main.py` and `modules/world_agent.py` have not yet been updated to integrate V1 `CharacterAgent` changes (pending Subtask 7.4).
- **Full V1 Context Integration:** Prompts in `CharacterAgent` are ready for richer V1 contexts (subjective view, plot, relationships), but the data from `PerspectiveFilter`, `PlotManager`, and `RelationshipManager` isn't being passed yet, as these managers are pending implementation/integration.
- **`load_full_preset` in `ConfigLoader`:** Still needs to be fully adapted to handle V1 `CharacterConfig` files seamlessly within the preset loading mechanism (e.g., determining whether to load V0 or V1 roles).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Next Subtask:** Proceed with Subtask 7.3: Implement Relationship Manager (Basic).
- **V1 Focus:** Continue prioritizing V1 architecture implementation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to V1 design documents: `memory-bank/v1/systemPatterns.md`, `memory-bank/v1/tasks.md`, `memory-bank/v1/prompt_design.md`.
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- Pydantic for data modeling.
- Incremental development with unit testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Test Maintenance:** Keeping tests aligned with evolving data models and library-specific error messages is crucial and requires ongoing attention.
- **Refactoring Impact:** Changes in one module (like `CharacterAgent` moving to `CharacterConfig`) have ripple effects that require updates in dependent modules and their tests. Staging these integrations (like Subtask 7.4) helps manage complexity.

## Current Database/Model State
- New Pydantic model `CharacterConfig` and `InitialGoals` in `modules/data_models.py`.
- Example V1 role file `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json`.
- No persistent database in use.
