# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Implementing FicWorld V1 Architecture - Phase 7: V1 Improvements - Part 1**
  - Subtask 7.1 (Enhance Character Data & Loading) is largely complete: V1 `CharacterConfig` model created, example V1 role JSON added, `ConfigLoader` updated for V1 roles, and `CharacterAgent.__init__` adapted for `CharacterConfig`.
  - Subtask 7.2 (Enhance Agent Prompts) is in progress: `CharacterAgent` prompt helper methods (`_prepare_character_system_prompt`, `_prepare_reflection_prompt`, `_prepare_plan_prompt`) and `Narrator.render()` have been updated to incorporate V1 design elements and prepare for V1 contexts.
  - About to start Subtask 7.3 (Implement Relationship Manager - Basic).

## What's Working
- **V1 Data Model:** `CharacterConfig` Pydantic model defined in `modules/data_models.py`.
- **V1 Example Role:** `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json` created and conforms to `CharacterConfig`.
- **V1 Config Loading (Partial):** `modules/config_loader.py` now has `load_character_config_v1` for loading V1 role files.
- **V1 Character Agent Init:** `modules/character_agent.py` correctly initializes with `CharacterConfig`, storing `full_name`, `backstory`, and structured `initial_goals`.
- **V1 Prompt Helpers (Initial Updates):** `CharacterAgent` prompt helpers and `Narrator.render` have been updated to reflect V1 prompt designs from `memory-bank/v1/prompt_design.md`, using new V1 fields and preparing for richer V1 contexts (like subjective views, relationship context, plot context) with fallbacks.
- **V1 Narrator Style:** `Narrator.render()` now accepts an `author_style` parameter.

## What's Broken / To Be Implemented / Needs Improvement
- **Unit Tests:** Unit tests for the V1 changes made in Subtask 7.1 and 7.2 (`CharacterConfig`, `ConfigLoader.load_character_config_v1`, `CharacterAgent` updates, `Narrator` updates) are planned but not yet implemented.
- **Full V1 Context Integration:** The prompt helper methods in `CharacterAgent` are structured for V1 contexts (subjective view, plot, relationships), but the actual data for these contexts is not yet being piped through from their respective V1 managers (`PerspectiveFilter`, `PlotManager`, `RelationshipManager`) as these are not yet implemented or fully integrated.
- **`load_full_preset` in `ConfigLoader`:** Needs to be updated to handle loading V1 `CharacterConfig` files alongside or instead of V0 `RoleArchetype` files, based on preset specifications.
- **Performance:** (Carried over from previous context) Performance of the overall simulation loop remains a concern due to sequential LLM calls.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **V1 Focus:** Proceeding with V1 implementation, prioritizing new architecture over V0 backward compatibility.
- **Iterative Prompt Enhancement:** Prompts will continue to be refined as V1 managers (PerspectiveFilter, PlotManager, RelationshipManager) are implemented and integrated, providing richer context to the agents.
- **Deferred Unit Testing:** Unit test implementation for recent changes is deferred temporarily to maintain momentum on feature implementation, but will be addressed.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to V1 design documents: `memory-bank/v1/systemPatterns.md`, `memory-bank/v1/tasks.md`, `memory-bank/v1/prompt_design.md`.
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- Pydantic for data modeling.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Codebase Awareness:** The initial oversight of existing `ConfigLoader` underscores the need for careful codebase exploration before adding new modules, especially in larger projects.
- **Phased V1 Context Integration:** Updating prompts to *accept* V1-style context parameters (even with fallbacks) before the data sources are fully ready allows for smoother integration later.

## Current Database/Model State
- New Pydantic model `CharacterConfig` introduced in `modules/data_models.py`.
- Example V1 role file `data/roles/lacia_eldridge_v1.json` created.
- No persistent database in use.
