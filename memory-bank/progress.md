## Changes Since Last Update
- **World Agent Implementation (Phase 4 Completed):**
  - Implemented `WorldAgent` class in `modules/world_agent.py`.
  - Refactored core `WorldAgent` methods to be primarily LLM-driven for narrative decisions:
    - `judge_scene_end`: Uses LLM to evaluate scene conclusion based on narrative flow.
    - `choose_pov_character_for_scene`: Uses LLM to select the most compelling POV character.
    - `decide_next_actor`: Uses LLM to determine the next acting character based on dramatic potential.
    - `apply_plan`: Uses LLM to interpret character plans and generate rich textual outcomes.
    - `should_inject_event`: Uses LLM to decide if an environmental event is narratively appropriate.
    - `generate_event`: Can use LLM for contextual event generation, alongside script-triggered and random pool events.
    - `update_from_outcome`: Uses LLM to parse textual outcomes and extract structured state changes (location, conditions, time).
  - Made `WorldAgent` behavior configurable via `__init__` parameters for thresholds like max scene turns, event injection probabilities, and history limits.
  - Implemented robust fallback mechanisms for LLM-driven methods in case of API errors.
  - Corrected `CharacterState` attribute access from dictionary-style to dot notation throughout `WorldAgent`.
  - Updated `tests/test_world_agent.py` to reflect LLM-driven logic, configurable parameters, and fixed `CharacterState` access. All tests are passing.
  - Addressed an `AttributeError` in `generate_event` related to `current_beat` handling.
- **Narrator Module Implementation (Phase 5 Completed):**
  - Implemented `Narrator` class in `modules/narrator.py`.
  - Developed the `render()` method to convert scene logs into narrative prose using LLM calls, adhering to `prompt_design.md` for `NARRATOR_SYSTEM` and `NARRATOR_USER` prompts.
  - Ensured `render()` uses the synchronous `llm_interface.generate_response_sync()` to prevent unawaited coroutine issues.
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_narrator.py` covering initialization, successful narration, various LLM response formats, and error handling.
- **Configuration Enhancements:**
  - Created `modules/ficworld_config.py` to store global default settings.
  - Made `LLM_MODEL_NAME` in `LLMInterface` configurable via `ficworld_config.py`.
  - Made `DEFAULT_NARRATOR_LITERARY_TONE` and `DEFAULT_NARRATOR_TENSE_INSTRUCTIONS` in `Narrator` configurable via `ficworld_config.py`.
  - Updated unit tests for `Narrator` to use and verify against these configurable defaults.

## Errors Encountered and Learnings
- **Dataclass Attribute Access:** Reinforced learning about correct attribute access (dot notation) for dataclass instances nested within other data structures, resolving multiple `AttributeError` and `TypeError` instances in `WorldAgent` and its tests.
- **Testing State Changes in Mutable Objects:** The `test_apply_plan_llm` failure highlighted the subtleties of testing modifications to mutable objects that are part of a larger state. Debugging involved careful tracing of object IDs and ensuring assertions accurately reflected the state at the precise moment of checking. Using local variables for assertion values proved helpful.
- **LLM-Driven Logic Trade-offs:** Transitioning `WorldAgent` to be heavily LLM-driven greatly enhances flexibility and emergent possibilities. However, it necessitates meticulous prompt engineering, robust error/fallback handling, and careful management of context provided to the LLMs. Parsing LLM outputs (especially for structured data like in `update_from_outcome`) also requires careful design.
- **Configuration for Fine-Tuning:** Making simulation parameters (e.g., scene length, event frequency) in `WorldAgent` configurable is crucial for allowing users or developers to fine-tune the narrative generation process without code changes.
- **Async Test Warnings:** Noted `RuntimeWarning` and `DeprecationWarning` for `async` test methods in `test_character_agent.py`. This will need to be addressed by potentially using an async-compatible test runner or framework adjustments for those specific tests.
- **Async/Sync LLM Calls in Synchronous Methods:** Encountered `RuntimeWarning: coroutine ... was never awaited` and subsequent test failures when the synchronous `Narrator.render()` method called an asynchronous method (`generate_response`) of the `LLMInterface`.
- **Learning:** Reinforced the necessity of using synchronous wrappers (e.g., `generate_response_sync`) or appropriately managing async event loops when calling asynchronous code from synchronous contexts. This is crucial for both correct runtime behavior and testability.
- **Testing with Configurable Defaults:** When making components use configurable default values, unit tests should also be updated to reference these defaults. This ensures tests are validating against the actual behavior determined by the configuration, making them more robust to changes in default settings.

## Next Steps Planned
- **Phase 6: Simulation Loop Orchestration (`main.py`):**
  - Instantiate all core components (`ConfigLoader`, `LLMInterface`, `MemoryManager`, `WorldAgent`, `CharacterAgent`s, `Narrator`).
  - Implement the main simulation loop as detailed in `systemPatterns.md`, managing scenes, turns, agent actions, memory updates, and narration.
  - Output the final story to `outputs/<preset_name>/story.md` and optionally `simulation_log.jsonl`.
  - Develop initial integration tests for the main loop.
- Address any remaining `async` test warnings in `test_character_agent.py`.

## Changes Since Last Update
- **Character Agent Implementation (Phase 3 Completed):**
  - Created `CharacterAgent` class in `modules/character_agent.py` with its core methods:
    - Implemented `__init__` method to store persona, goals, mood, and dependencies.
    - Implemented `reflect()` method for private introspection and mood updates based on world state and memories.
    - Implemented `plan()` method to generate structured JSON action plans influenced by mood and private reflection.
  - Implemented comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_character_agent.py`, covering:
    - Initialization with correct field mappings from `RoleArchetype`
    - Proper construction of system prompts with relevant memory and world state context
    - Successful reflection with mood updates and internal thought generation
    - Structured plan generation with appropriate JSON validation
    - Error handling for edge cases in both reflection and planning
    - Synchronous wrapper functions for both main methods
  - Enhanced prompt engineering for both reflection and planning to align with `prompt_design.md` guidelines:
    - Updated prompts to include clearer context and instructions
    - Ensured proper JSON schema specification in the prompts
    - Added memory and world state information directly in system prompts

## Errors Encountered and Learnings
- **Data Model Field Name Consistency:** When implementing the `CharacterAgent` class, we found mismatches between the field names used in our tests and the actual field names in the `RoleArchetype` class. Tests were using `name`, `persona`, `goals`, and `starting_mood`, while the model defined `archetype_name`, `persona_template`, `goal_templates`, and `starting_mood_template`.
- **Learning:** It's important to ensure consistent field naming across the codebase and tests, especially when working with data models that are used in multiple places. When data models evolve, all dependent code and tests need to be updated to match.
- **Prompt Design Implementation:** Implementing the prompt guidelines from `prompt_design.md` required ensuring that memory and world state information is properly formatted and included in both system and user prompts.
- **Learning:** Dynamic prompt construction is more effective when the system prompt includes relevant context rather than relying solely on the user prompt. This allows the LLM to "stay in character" more consistently while also having access to memories and environment details.

## Next Steps Planned
- **Phase 4: World Agent Implementation:**
  - Define `WorldAgent` class in `modules/world_agent.py`
  - Implement scene management methods (`init_scene`, `judge_scene_end`, `choose_pov_character_for_scene`)
  - Implement actor and event management methods (`decide_next_actor`, `apply_plan`, `should_inject_event`, `generate_event`)
  - Write unit tests for `WorldAgent` class

## Changes Since Last Update
- **Unit Tests for LLM Interface and Memory Manager (Phase 2 Completed):**
  - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `LLMInterface` in `tests/test_llm_interface.py`, covering:
    - Successful initialization and API key handling
    - Text and JSON response generation (both async and sync methods)
    - Error handling for API errors and JSON parsing failures
    - Heuristic JSON parsing for responses
  - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `MemoryManager` in `tests/test_memory.py`, covering:
    - Initialization and memory store management
    - Memory creation and storage (LTM and STM)
    - Memory retrieval (MVP implementation)
    - Scene summarization (MVP concatenation)
    - Memory clearing and resetting operations
  - Fixed a test issue in `test_summarise_scene_mvp` related to newline character representation in expected vs. actual output

## Errors Encountered and Learnings
- **Newline Character Representation in Tests:** When testing string equality with newline characters, we discovered that using escaped newlines (`\\n`) in the expected string created a mismatch with actual newlines (`\n`) in the output. This is because the escape sequence `\\n` in a string literal becomes a literal backslash followed by 'n' in the actual string, not a newline character.
- **Learning:** When writing tests involving multi-line strings, be careful with string literal representation, especially for special characters like newlines. Use raw strings (`r"..."`) or actual newline characters as appropriate for expected values.

## Next Steps Planned
- **Phase 3: Character Agent Implementation:**
  - Define `
