## Changes Since Last Update
- **Core Project Setup (Phase 1 Complete):**
    - Created `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies.
    - Created `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
    - Defined core data structures (e.g., `MoodVector`, `RoleArchetype`, `WorldDefinition`, `Preset`, `MemoryEntry`, `LogEntry`) as Python dataclasses in `modules/models.py`.
    - Implemented `ConfigLoader` in `modules/config_loader.py` capable of loading presets, world definitions, and role archetypes from JSON files.
    - Created initial `main.py` with command-line argument parsing (for `--preset`) and logic to use `ConfigLoader` to load and display configurations.
    - Added `modules/__init__.py` to make `modules` a Python package.
    - Created sample data files:
        - World: `data/worlds/haunted_forest.json`
        - Roles: `data/roles/scholar.json`, `data/roles/knight.json`, `data/roles/mystic.json`
        - Preset: `presets/demo_forest_run.json`
    - Created sample prompt templates:
        - `data/prompts/character_reflect.txt`
        - `data/prompts/character_plan.txt`
- **LLM Interface & Basic Memory (Phase 2 Started):**
    - Implemented `LLMInterface` in `modules/llm_interface.py`, configured to use OpenRouter. This includes methods for generating text and JSON responses, with both async and sync versions.
    - Implemented an MVP `MemoryManager` in `modules/memory.py` with in-memory lists for short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), and basic scene summarization (concatenation).
- **API Key Clarification:**
    - Updated `LLMInterface` and `README.md` (user performed direct edits) to use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` as the environment variable for the API key, replacing the previous `OPENAI_API_KEY` for better clarity, although the `openai` Python library is still used for the API calls due to OpenRouter's compatibility.

## New Commands or Changes to Commands
- N/A in this update.

## Errors Encountered and Learnings
- **Initial API Key Confusion:** Initially, `OPENAI_API_KEY` was used for the OpenRouter service because its API is OpenAI-compatible. This was identified as potentially confusing.
- **Learning:** It's clearer to use an environment variable name that directly reflects the service being accessed (i.e., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter), even if the underlying client library is from a different provider (like `openai`). This improves maintainability and reduces ambiguity for new developers or users setting up the project.

## Next Steps Planned
- **Phase 3: Character Agent Implementation:**
    - Define `CharacterAgent` class in `modules/character_agent.py`.
    - Implement the `__init__` method to store persona, goals, mood, and references to `LLMInterface` and `MemoryManager`.
    - Implement the `reflect()` method to process world state and memories, update mood, and generate internal thoughts using the `CHARACTER_REFLECT` prompt.
    - Implement the `plan()` method to generate a structured JSON action plan using the `CHARACTER_PLAN` prompt, influenced by mood and internal reflection.
